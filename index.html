                    Helen Adams Keller (June 27, 1880 – June 1, 1968) was an American author, political activist, and
                    lecturer. She was the first deaf-blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. The story of Keller
                    and her teacher, Anne Sullivan, was made famous by Keller's autobiography, The Story of My Life, and
                    its adaptations for film and stage, The Miracle Worker. Her birthplace in West Tuscumbia, Alabama,
                    is now a museum and sponsors an annual "Helen Keller Day".<br><br> Her June 27 birthday is
                    commemorated as Helen Keller Day in Pennsylvania and, in the centenary year of her birth, was
                    recognized by a presidential proclamation from U.S. President Jimmy Carter.

                    A prolific author, Keller was well-traveled and outspoken in her convictions. A member of the
                    Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World, she campaigned for women's
                    suffrage, labor rights, socialism, antimilitarism, and other similar causes. She was inducted into
                    the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1971 and was one of twelve inaugural inductees to the Alabama
                    Writers Hall of Fame on June 8, 2015.

                    In May 1888, Keller started attending the Perkins Institute for the Blind. In 1894, Keller and
                    Sullivan moved to New York to attend the Wright-Humason School for the Deaf, and to learn from Sarah
                    Fuller at the Horace Mann School for the Deaf. In 1896, they returned to Massachusetts, and Keller
                    entered The Cambridge School for Young Ladies before gaining admittance, in 1900, to Radcliffe
                    College of Harvard University, where she lived in Briggs Hall, South House. Her admirer, Mark Twain,
                    had introduced her to Standard Oil magnate Henry Huttleston Rogers, who, with his wife Abbie, paid
                    for her education. In 1904, at the age of 24, Keller graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa from
                    Radcliffe, becoming the first deaf-blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. She maintained a
                    correspondence with the Austrian philosopher and pedagogue Wilhelm Jerusalem, who was one of the
                    first to discover her literary talent.

                    Determined to communicate with others as conventionally as possible, Keller learned to speak and
                    spent much of her life giving speeches and lectures on aspects of her life. She learned to "hear"
                    people's speech using the Tadoma method, which means using her fingers to feel the lips and throat
                    of the speaker[citation needed]—her sense of touch had heightened. She became proficient at using
                    braille and reading sign language with her hands[citation needed] as well. Shortly before World War
                    I, with the assistance of the Zoellner Quartet, she determined that by placing her fingertips on a
                    resonant tabletop she could experience music played close by.
